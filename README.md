This repository contains MATLAB code for a multi-path planning algorithm for UAVs inspired by bee behavior. The algorithm is based on the concept of bees searching for optimal paths similar to their nectar collection behavior.

# Features
Dynamic path generation using a bee-inspired heuristic.
Optimization using Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) principles.
Constraint handling for path feasibility.

# How to Use
Clone the repository.
Open MATLAB and navigate to the cloned directory.
Run the main script (code6.m) to initiate the path planning.
